    <h1 style="color:rgb(214, 84, 106);border: 3px solid;"><b>MY FIRST WEEK AT AKIRACHIX.</b></h1> 
    <p>Hello...my name is Edith Kandie Mutai.A software engineering student at AkiraChix,codehive program.Coming into the program one thing was certain,i wanted the best out it.That is all 
        i was sure about though,the rest was uncertain.As time progresses though,the more interesting it becomes;the endless learning,the diversity,the environment.Everything keeps
     getting more interesting as i go by the program.The tech spark that i came with has grown a lot in the past two weeks,that is all contributed by a number of factors.I will be sharing a 
    number of things i have interacted with that strike me as interesting in program,and also some that i've found challenging.</p>
    <h2 style="color: red;border: 1px solid;">Loves.</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><u>Environment</u>:The environment effect has really been felt on my part partly because i believe that environment really has a psychological effect.The green environment,
        the nature,the fresh air and clean surroundings make me feel at peace.Which is essential for me to lock into my studies as i've been doing.
    </li>
    <li><u>The Diversity</u>:AkiraChix offers learning to students from many African countries,six in our cohort to be specific.The interaction with my fellow students,getting 
            to know each other,learning about other cultures, working together in class and getting to learn other interesting perspectives has been no doubt mind-nourishing.</li>
    <li><u>The Trainers and Administrators</u>:My interaction with the administrators began from the application into the codehive program last year.From that i obviously didn't 
            have the full picture but the impression stuck.Their kindness really went and has continued going a long way.So far i have interacted with most of the trainers and 
            so far so good.The training approach rather than lecturing makes learning extremely effective.</li>
    <li><u>The Staff</u>:The times i have engaged with the AkiraChix stuff in my day to day learning like the Chef at meals and the housekeeping department at the residences.All of them
            definately have one thing in common,kindness.Which makes the experience even more worthwhile.</li>
    <li><u>The food</u>:Nutrition is definately a major contribution to our learning process and AkiraChix has outdone themselves on that.The balanced diet,the taste and variety makes 
    life in AkiraChix very interesting.</li>
    </ol>
